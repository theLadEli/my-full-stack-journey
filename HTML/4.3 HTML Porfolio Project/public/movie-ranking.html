    <h1>Eli's Favourite Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>JoJo Rabbit</h3>
<p>I've watched it like five times, it's both hilarious and informative on the war. Before watching it I was pretty critical of a WWII comedy film, but after watching it I couldn't recommend it more!</p>

<h3>All Quiet on the Western Front</h3>
<p>This was both chilling and insightful at the same time. It showed the war from german soldiers perspective, illustrating the false glorification soldiers were impressioned.</p>

<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>Although it's not a movie but a trilogy, it still deserves a position on this list.</p>
