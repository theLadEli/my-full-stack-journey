# How it Works

## How the Internet Works
The internet is made up of computers connected to each other. When you put in a URL in the browser, it'll go to the DNS provider and find the correct IP for that URL and request the information. Than it'd send it back, and display it in your browser!

## How Websites Work
When a requested website is sent back to be displayed, it's set as code.
These are the three code languages usually used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JS

You can inpect web pages to see the coding of the site and edit the **local version** of the website. But refreshing the page will bring back the online and public version, obviously removing all your changes.

## Keywords/Notes:

* **URL -** Uniform Resource Locator - Like an address for a website
* **IP Address -** A bunch of numbers that identifies a device. A *URL* is usually used as a more catchy and more memorable replacer instead of an *IP Address*
* **DNS -** The *DNS* takes the *URL* and finds the correct *IP Address* to load
* **HTML -** Hyper Text Markup Language, the structure of a website (text, images, buttons etc.)
* **CSS -** Casscading Styles Sheets, the styling of the website (how the image appears, the size of the text, colour of the button etc.)
* **JSsss-** Javascript, the functioning of the website (What appears when you click something, what should the contact form do etc.)
