# My Full Stack Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository chronicling my full-stack development journey. This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my studies and projects, spanning multiple languages and web design principles. Each folder contains my notes, a easy to understand guide to the language, and subfolders with my hands-on projects.

## üõ£Ô∏è Repository Structure

This repository is divided into five main sections:

1. **HTML**: Contains my study notes and basic guide to HTML, as well as various projects showcasing my skills in structuring web pages. (*Note: This repo is out of date, I am still working through a backlog of old notes and projects, slowly adding it all*)

2. **CSS**: This folder includes my CSS notes and guide, along with projects demonstrating my ability to style and layout web pages. (*Note: This repo is also in the works*)

3. **JavaScript**: In this section, you will find my JavaScript notes, guide, and a host of projects. Many of these projects also contain their own README files, explaining the project goals, methodology, and reasons behind my choices.

4. **Python**: This is where I keep my Python study materials and guide, plus a range of projects that demonstrate my skills in Python programming. (*Currently ongoing*)

5. **Web Design**: This section houses my notes on web design principles, along with various web design projects I've completed. (*Still digitalising my notes for this*)

Each section provides (or will in the near future) a solid foundation of knowledge in the language and offers practical examples through the included projects. Feel free to explore, learn, and provide any feedback.
