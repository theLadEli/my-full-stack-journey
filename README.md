# My Full Stack Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository chronicling my full-stack development journey. This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my studies and projects, spanning multiple languages and web design principles. Each folder contains my notes, a easy to understand guide to the language, and subfolders with my hands-on projects.

## üõ£Ô∏è Repository Structure
To help learn and understand the languages I learn, I've written my own documentation (for most) while studying.
