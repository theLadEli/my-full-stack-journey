# RegEx
RegEx stands for Regular Expressions. If you have a document that contains various pieces of information, like a phone number, DOB etc. The information pieces will often be in very different formats. So RegEx lets you extract pieces of text in a specific pattern.

So instead of searching through text based on a few characters, you can search through text using a pattern. So for example search through all DOB's using this structure: `xx/xx/xxxx`

## Why use RegEx
There are many reasons, some of them include:
 - Searching for specific information
 - Input validation, so if you only want to except a password input if it follows a certain pattern
