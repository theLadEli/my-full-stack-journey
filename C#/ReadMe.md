# C# Basics

## Compiler and Interpreter
A compiler and interpreter transforms the code we input on a machine, into something the CPU understands and works with.

A compiler turns your code into an executable program that can run over and over, independently of any other software. An interpreter is a software program that turns your code (or script) into CPU instructions as needed, as the script executes.;

## .Net's Place

### .Net
`.Net` addresses the issue of different operating systems and CPU's by providing a common instruction set, called the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR is software that gets installed onto computers where you want to run .Net programs, so now, instead of coding against the OS, you code against the CLR.

`.Net` was not the first runtime environment that could be deployed to various Operating Systems, Java and the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Virtual Machine.

There are several other languages that offer .Net compatibility.

### .Net Framework
.Net started many years ago as a windows only runtime environment, which we now know as the .Net Framework. Over the years, this has evolved, starting with support for Windform Applications (Windows Apps that use native Windows controls). Then ASP was added, to support web development, followed by Silverlight (to support rich and customisable graphical interfaces).

### .Net Versions
.Net now supports a wide range of devices and use-cases, from Windows, Web, Cloud, Gaming, Mobile, IoT devices and even Ai. To support all these devices, this means different versions of .Net exists.

1. .Net Framework
2. Mono / Xamarin, an open source .Net implementation for Linux which then evolved to an android development environment
3. .Net Core
