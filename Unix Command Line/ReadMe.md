# UNIX Command Line

## What is a Shell
In computing the Kernel refers to the actual program that interfaces with the hardware. The Shell refers to the User Interface, so users can interact with the Kernel and in turn the hardware of the computer.

There's two variants of the Shell:
    1. GUI - Graphical User Interface
    Windows Explorer is an example of a GUI, you're using a graphical interface to locate and access your files.
    2. CLI - Command Line Interface
    This is an alternative way to interface with the Kernel.

## Bash Shell
Bash Shell stands for "Bourne Again SHell", it is named after Mr Bourne. It is a CLI for the UNIX system, which you'll find all over. Linux runs on UNIX, so do many servers and macOS runs on a UNIX-like version.

## Why Use the Command Line
The main reason, is for greater control. The better a developer you want to be, the more you'd need to understand and have control over the tools you are working with. Once you get the hang of it, it is actually easier and faster to work with then GUI's.
