# CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. A cascade is like a waterfall, you have water on one level that falls down onto another level. This is like CSS, you have styles targeting broad elements and then it gets more and more specific.

CSS isn't the only styling language, there are:
 - CSS - Cascading Style Sheets (this)
 - SASS - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet
 - Less - Leaner CSS
 - Many others...
