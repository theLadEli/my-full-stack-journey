# Tailwind

## What is it?
Tailwind is a CSS framwork, its a huge collection of CSS utility classes. Compared to plain CSS it allows you to write less code overall - although unlike bootstrap, Tailwind does not offer prebuilt components.

## Does it affect site speed?
It uses Dead Code Elimination, so it eliminates the class styling of those you're not using. Making it load only the relevant styling, resulting in a faster load time.
