# Incrementing and Decrementing

```js
var x = 5;
x = x + 1;
```
Here, first, we set `x` to `5`. Then we set `x` to equal its previous value, `5`, and add `1` onto that.
So now, `x = 6`.
* Notice how we didnt use `var` on the second line, as the variable has already been defined, we're just changing it.


## Incrementing
```js
var x = 5;
x++;
```
If we just want to add 1 onto the variable, we could just do `x++` and that'd add `1` onto the last variable value, so it'd make `x = 6`.


## Decrementing
```js
var x = 5
x--;
```
The same can be done with deducting, here `x = 4` as we deducted one from its latest value using `x--`.
