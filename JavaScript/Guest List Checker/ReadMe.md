# Guest List Checker
#### Aim: To check a guests name and tell them if they were invited or not

### Solution:

* First i'll make an array with all the guest names in it
* Next i'll make a variable called `name` and make the value of the variable a prompt that asks the guests name
* Than we'll use conditional logic - `if`/`else` with the `.includes` property to check if the guest is invited
* `If` the array includes `name`, we'll make an alert that says welcome
* `Else` we'll make an alert that says **"Sorry, you're not invited"**
