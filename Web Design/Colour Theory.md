# Colour Theory
Colour theory is the art and science of creating the right colour pallette for your website.

## Colour Moods

Take this image for example, they both have the exact same font, layout and sizing. But the one on the left really doesn't look nice. The colour of the flowers looks a bit like dirt, and the pink colouring on the Paintball logo really just doesn't fit.

But when you flip the colouring around, as shown on the right column, you can see how much better it looks. And all we did was used different colours.

So, when you're picking colours you have to be aware of the mood of your colour palette. As you can see above, each colour refelcts on a different mood. So the primary colour you choose should really be the appropriate mood your aiming for with the website.

For example, red converys Excitement, Strength and Energy. Which is why you'd see red being used a lot on car advertisments. It's trying to tell you to "buy this car and you'd feel energetic...!"

A colour like yellow, is very attention grabbing. So whilst it might be good on a poster, if you'd want it on something thats to be looked at, or read for a long period of time - yellow might not be the best colour for it.

Green reflects freshness, growth and safety. Which is why you'd see a lot of grocery companies using it. As you can see Hellow Fresh and Amazon Fresh use it.

Blue is about stability, trust and serenity. You can see a lot of financial companies like PayPal, Coinbase or WeBull, as they want it to reflect those messages.

## Combining Colours
You can't really just use a single colour for your design, you'd probably be using 2 or 3. So you'd need to start thinking about which different colours to combine - which is probably the most scientific point about colour theory.

### Analogous Colour Pallette
Designers often use what's called an analogous colour pallette, which is two colours that are next to eachother on the colour pallette. This can be good for things like navigation bars and the body of your website.

### Complementory Colours
This is when you take two colours from opposite ends of the colour pallete, so it really makes it clash/pop! You'd see this usually done with the meat aisle at your grocery store. They put these fake bright green greenery in between the meet in the aisle, and it really makes the redness of the meet pop and standout to customers - and also gives you this idea of freshness! But **DON'T** try and style text on a background with complementory colours, as it really doesn't fit well, it actually makes it look very jarring and unattractive.
